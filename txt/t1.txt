Patient Name: Jane Doe
Date of Birth: 1978-05-15
Age: 46

Patient ID: 1234567
Accession Number: P2024-0001
Date Received: 2024-10-26
Date Reported: 2024-10-28

Clinical History:
A 2cm skin lesion was excised from the patient's back. Clinically, a diagnosis of melanoma was suspected.

Specimen Received:
A single, formalin-fixed, 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, tan-white skin specimen, labeled "Back Lesion."

Gross Description:
The specimen consists of an elliptical piece of skin, measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is tan-white, with a central, pigmented lesion measuring 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The lesion is firm and appears to extend to the surgical margin. The specimen was entirely submitted for microscopic examination.

Microscopic Description:
Sections show a proliferation of atypical melanocytes involving the epidermis and dermis. The melanocytes exhibit nuclear pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, and frequent mitotic figures. The tumor extends to the lateral and deep surgical margins. There is evidence of dermal invasion.

Diagnosis:
Malignant melanoma, invasive.

Comments:
The tumor extends to the surgical margins. Re-excision is recommended to ensure complete removal of the tumor. Immunohistochemical stains for Melan-A and HMB-45 were positive, confirming melanocytic differentiation.

Pathologist:
Dr. John Smith, MD
